Any unauthorized modification, reverse engineering, or distribution (including re-uploading of any kind) is strictly prohibited.




-------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTE!!
-------------------------
Traffic Control is now an LSPDFR Plugin!!
Traffic Control was formerly an RPH (Rage Plugin Hook) plugin, which was not connected to LSPDFR at all.
This plugin now makes use of the LSPDFR API, and as a result, REQUIRES LSPDFR, and MUST BE INSTALLED IN YOUR "Plugins\LSPDFR" directory, just like a callout plugin.

PLEASE REMOVE "TrafficControl.dll" and "TrafficControl.ini" FROM YOUR "Plugins" DIRECTORY, AND DO NOT INSTALL THESE FILES IN THAT FOLDER!




-------------------------
Requirements
-------------------------
- You must have version 0.62 (or newer) of the RAGE Plugin Hook installed. You must have a fully legal, non-pirated version of GTA V.
- You must have version 0.3.1 (or newer) of LSPDFR installed.
- The version of Stealth.Common.dll included with this package is v2.0.6684.38422. (NOTE: Older versions will not work!!)
- Traffic Control WILL CHECK what versions of RPH and Stealth.Common you have installed. It will refuse to run if incorrect versions are installed.

-------------------------
Automatic Installation
-------------------------
- Run "Traffic Control.msi" to install the plugin
- The installer package requires Administrator rights to run
- The setup package will attempt to detect your Grand Theft Auto installation path using the registry. If the install path is not found, your copy of GTA V has not been properly installed

-------------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------------
- Extract the entire zip file into your Grand Theft Auto V directory. All files will be placed in their proper locations.

-------------------------
Features

- Stop or slow down all traffic within a certain radius of the player, in order to close a road for investigative purposes, or for safety reasons during a traffic stop
- Multiple "roadblocks" or "speed zones" can be placed
- Roadblocks will remain in place until removed by the player
- The 'Police Ignore Roadblocks' setting to allow any emergency vehicles to drive through "roadblocks"/"stop zones" can be enabled in the INI file ("Stop Traffic" orders only; speed restrictions are not affected)

- Traffic Control now includes a new in-game menu, powered by RAGENativeUI!
- Keyboard shortcuts can now be changed in the INI file!
- Keyboard shortcuts can be disabled, if desired (to use the in-game menu exclusively)

-------------------------
Usage
-------------------------
- Press the menu keybind (CTRL + F10 by default) to open the Traffic Control menu; use the menu options to place/remove roadblocks
- Alternatively, you can use the shortcut keys (see the INI file) to place/remove roadblocks
- Keyboard shortcuts can be disabled through the INI file, if you wish to only use the in-game menu
